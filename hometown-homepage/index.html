        <h3>Brief History of Osun State</h3>
        <p>Osun State (/ˈoʊʃuːn/; Yoruba: Ìpínlẹ̀ Ọ̀ṣun), occasionally known as the State of Osun by the state
            government, is a state in southwestern Nigeria; bounded to the east by Ekiti and Ondo states, to the
            north by Kwara State, to the south by Ogun State and to the west by Oyo State. Named for the River
            Osun—a vital river which flows through the state—the state was formed from the southeast of Oyo State on
            27 August 1991 and has its capital as the city of Osogbo.</p>

        <p>Of the 36 states of Nigeria, Osun is the ninth smallest in area and nineteenth most populous with an
            estimated population of about 4.7 milliGeographically, the state is divided between
            the Nigerian lowland forests in most of the state and the drier Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the
            north. The major geographical features are rivers including the state's namesake, the River Osun which
            bisects the state's interior before forming much of the state's southwestern border with Oyo State and
            flowing south. Other important rivers are the Erinle and Oba rivers, both Osun tributaries which flow
            from the north before meeting the Osun along the southwestern border. Among the state's fauna are mona
            monkey, common kestrel, purple heron, and royal antelope, along with some of Nigeria's last remaining
            Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee and African forest elephant which inhabit the heavily threatened forests
            along the southern borders with Ondo and Ogun states.</p>

        <p>Osun State is primarily inhabited by the Yoruba people, mainly of the Ibolo, Ifẹ, Igbomina, Ijesha, and
            Oyo subgroups. In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Osun State was split up between various
            Western Yoruba
            states with some states being town-based as others were part of larger empires like the Oyo Empire. From
            1877 to 1893, Western Yoruba states fought the Kiriji War alongside other Eastern Yoruba groups against
            Eastern Yoruba groups; the war ended in a British-brokered stalemate before the area was colonized and
            incorporated into the British Southern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria in
            1914. After independence in 1960, the area of now-Osun was a part of the post-independence Western
            Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the Western State. In 1976, the
            Western State was split and the state's west became Oyo State. Fifteen years later, Oyo State's east was
            broken off to form Osun State.</p>

        <p>Economically, Osun State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of cocoa, cassava, millet, maize,
            potato and yam crops. Other key industries are services, especially in urban areas, along with artisanal
            mining and livestock herding. Osun is home to several of Nigeria's most famous landmarks, including the
            campus of Obafemi Awolowo University, one of Nigeria's pre-eminent institutions of higher learning. The
            university is located in the ancient town of Ile-Ifẹ, an important early center of political and
            religious development for Yoruba culture. Other important cities and towns include the ancient
            kingdom-capitals of Ila Orangun, Iragbiji, Ada, Ikirun, Oke-Ila Orangun, Ipetu-Ijesha, Ijebu-Jesa,Erin
            Oke, Ipetumodu, Ede, Iwo, Ejigbo, Ibokun, Ode-Omu, Otan Ayegbaju, Ifetedo, Esa-Oke, Ilesa, Okuku,
            Otan-Ile and Igbajo. Osun State is additionally noted for having the second highest literacy rate in the
            country.</p>
